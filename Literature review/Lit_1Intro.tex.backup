\section{Introduction}\label{int}
In this paper we will discuss the literature and resources required to create the sky tessellation algorithm and the techniques which could be used to optimize it.
\\
We will begin by looking at the background of the problem in radio astronomy. We will see how radio telescopes work, how the image is created and how direction-dependent effects occur.
