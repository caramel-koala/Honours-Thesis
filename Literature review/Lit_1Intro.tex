\section{Introduction}\label{int}
In this paper we will discuss the literature and resources required to create the sky tessellation algorithm and the techniques which could be used to optimize it.
\\
We will begin by looking at the background of the problem in radio astronomy. We will see how radio telescopes work, how the image is created and how direction-dependent effects occur and how they can be corrected.
\\
We will then look at Voronoi tessellations, what they are and variations in how they work. We will especially focus on Voronoi tessellations of weighted points and where the space being operated in is non-Euclidean. Tessellation algorithms will also be looked at as well as algorithms for clustering data. Their efficiencies and complexities will also be discussed.
\\
Lastly we will look at parallelism, GPU architecture and the technicalities of programming on a GPU. We will discuss the hardware to be used, the NVIDIA GTX 750 Ti, and the GPU programming language CUDA. The optimizations of GPUs and CUDA will also be discussed.
