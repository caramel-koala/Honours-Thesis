\subsection{Parallelism}\label{gpu:sec:par}
One of the main means of optimizing processing is through parallelism. The two main forms of parallelism are task and data parallelism. Task parallelism can be seen as running multiple processes concurrently where communication between the processes is explicitly defined to avoid race conditions. Data parallelism is the distribution of a data set over a number of identical processes each of which performs operations on a unique subset of the data. Race conditions occur when parallel processing streams access data or perform operations out of the intended order, leading to errors or incorrect output being produced. A combination of task and data parallelism can lead to an ideal speed-up, but both have their limits depending on the task and the data being operated on \cite{subhlok1993exploiting}.

The increased need for parallelism came in about 2005, when CPU frequency peaked at 4GHz due to heat dissipation issues. However, Moore's Law still holds, and is still expected to hold until 2025; that is, that the number of transistors for a computer will double every two years. This leads to a problem where the speed at which an operation is done cannot be increased (due to the frequency limit), but the number of concurrent operations can still increase. This means that the only way to speed up an operation is to change it from a sequential to a parallel process \cite{rajan2013informatics}.
