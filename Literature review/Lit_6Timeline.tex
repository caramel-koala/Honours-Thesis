\section{Project Time-line}

\subsection{February - March 2016}
During this time research will be done into Voronoi Diagrams and the language to be used for the sequential implementation of the algorithm. The tessellation algorithm will begin to be formulated.

\subsection{April-May 2016}
The tessellation algorithm will be formulated to solve the problem. Research will be done on parallel processing and GPU processing. The literature review will be compiled and submitted by the end of May. Sequential implementation of the algorithm will begin.

\subsection{June - July 2016}
Time will be dedicated to the midyear exams and coursework projects. The tessellation algorithm will be tested as a sequential algorithm. More research will be done on GPU processing and parallel implementation will begin. The last 2 weeks of July will be dedicated mainly to coursework.

\subsection{August - September 2016}
The first 2 weeks of August will be dedicated mainly to coursework. The algorithm will be tested on a GPU for parallel processing. The algorithm will be iteratively optimised and retested both in the mathematical sense and in terms of the GPU. The final thesis write up will be compiled.

\subsection{October 2016}
The algorithm and its implementation will be continually optimised. The thesis will be completed and submitted by the end of October.
