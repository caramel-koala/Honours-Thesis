\section{Summary}
In this chapter the proposed tessellation algorithm was designed and discussed. We began by looking at how the sources are restructured to produce centres. We discussed how these centres are used to produce Voronoi tessellations using the divide and conquer algorithm as well as why the divide and conquer is not suitable for weighted tessellation generation. We looked at how the error metric can be used to measure the performance of the tessellation algorithm. Using this error metric, the cell merge algorithm was designed to improve on the tessellation by merging cells using the error metric to ensure it performs as well as possible.
