\section{Contribution of Research}
Referring to the research objectives stated in Section \ref{int:sec:goals}, the contributions of the research done in this thesis are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The divide and conquer algorithm was implemented to generate the Voronoi tessellation faster than that of the current best model which used a naive k-means clustering of all points in the space to generate the tessellation. The neighbouring structure generated by the divide and conquer was also beneficial for the cell merge algorithm implemented later.
\item 
\item 
\item 
\end{enumerate}
