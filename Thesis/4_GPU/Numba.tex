\section{Numba}
Numba is an optimized compiler for python. It's development project is sponsored by Continuum Analytics and is available either through Continuum's high performance python distribution platform, Anaconda or by directly downloading the compiler from the site\footnote{http://numba.pydata.org/}.
\\
\\
Numba is optimized for array-based, mathematically intensive code and uses a just-in-time (jit) compiler to compile code to native machine instructions to produce performance similar to that of C, C++ and Fortran.
\\
\\
GPU support is also included into Numba, as well as an API to interface with NVIDIA's GPU programming language, CUDA.
