\section{Errors with the Parallel Merge}
It was noted that merges generated on the GPU differed slightly from those generated using the sequential algorithm. While the error increases for both are, to a degree, nearly equal, the slight variances lead to different final tessellations for the same set of sources. This can be seen in the differences between Figure \ref{gpu:fig:seqm} with the sequential merge and Figure \ref{gpu:fig:parm}. The reason for this is most likely due to the way in which CUDA executes floating point operations on the GPU \citep{CUDA}. While the differences in these calculations lead to slightly varying results, the fact that the global error and number of cells are nearly equivalent as well means that results generated by the GPU are still valid.
