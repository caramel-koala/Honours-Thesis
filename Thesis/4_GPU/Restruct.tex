\section{Data Restructuring}
The Voronoi data structure, as stated in the previous chapter, consists of centres (Section \ref{sec:design:source}) and lines (Section \ref{sec:des:struct}) linked together by relational centre-line tuples stored in the centre's  list of related centres. While this structure is relatively simple for a sequential CPU system to traverse, GPU's are designed to make use of sequential data readings and therefore traversing a large structure of pointers would be difficult for the GPU to traverse. Increasing the need for a data restructuring is the fact that a structure of values with pointers pointing to different locations in memory can be difficult to transfer to a GPU which is designed to operate on basic data types.

It was noted that not all of the data from the Voronoi structure would be needed. In order to obtain the best merge, the data that would be needed would be:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The location of the centre of the cell.
\item The intensity of the cell.
\item The error of the cell.
\item The neighbouring cells of the cell.
\item The sources located in the cell.
\end{enumerate}
\\

It was therefore determined that three multidimensional arrays would be created to store the necessary data to obtain the best possible merge. Given $n$ centres, the arrays are defined as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An $n\times4$ array of 32 bit floats to store the position, intensity and error of the cell.
\item An $n \times n$ array of integers storing the
\end{enumerate}
