\section{Summary}
This chapter has focused on the results obtained from this research. The cell merge algorithm was found to be more favourable than the Voronoi tessellation alone for most tessellations and that the Voronoi was only preferred if very few cells are generated. For the parallel implementation of the cell merge, the speed-ups obtained increased as the number of centres increased. For very small sets of sources, the performance of the cell merge was found to be better on the sequential compared to the parallel implementation. It was also discovered that, due to the high memory cost of the parallel implementation and the limited amount of memory on the GPU, the parallel implementation could only generate tessellations for up to 7500 sources.
