\section{Introduction}\label{int}
In this paper we discuss the literature and resources required to create the sky tessellation algorithm and the techniques which could be used to optimize it.
\\
We begin by looking at the background of the problem in radio astronomy. We discuss how radio telescopes work, how the image is created and how direction-dependent effects occur and how they can be corrected.
\\
We then look at Voronoi tessellations, what they are and variations in how they work. We focus especially on Voronoi tessellations of weighted points. Tessellation algorithms are also be explained as well as algorithms for clustering data. Their efficiencies and complexities are also discussed.
\\
Lastly we look at parallelism, \gls{gpu} architecture and the technicalities of programming on a \gls{gpu}. We discuss the hardware to be used, the NVIDIA GTX 750 Ti, and the \gls{gpu} programming language CUDA. The optimizations of GPUs and CUDA are also discussed.
