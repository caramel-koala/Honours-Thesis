In order to evaluate the algorithms designed in this research, comparative testing was done. For evaluating the cell merge, the total error for a given number of cells was compared with the error of a Voronoi tessellation using the same data sources. The Voronoi tessellation was generated using the divide-and-conquer (Section \ref{des:sec:vor}) with the brightest sources used as centres. The cell merge algorithm (Section \ref{des:sec:merge}) was implemented by first generating a Voronoi tessellation with all sources as centres and performing the cell merge algorithm on the sources until the desired number of cells was obtained.

To evaluate the parallel implementation of the cell merge algorithm, the execution time of the process was measured and compared with that of the sequential cell merge algorithm. The operations were timed from the moment the algorithms diverged until they returned the final tessellation structures. The parallel implementation was tested on an EVGA NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 Ti (Section \ref{gpu:sec:750}).
